This project involved designing and delivering end-to-end business intelligence solutions for the company by creating a PowerBI sales report for the company.

On this project, I identified and tracked KPIs like (Net Sales, Profit, Orders, and Returns) and showed insights on a monthly, weekly, quarterly, and yearly basis. This also involved collecting the data, cleaning, transforming the data, and creating new custom tables and columns. Building table relationships, and in page navigation.
